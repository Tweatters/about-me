		Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
		I am an <span>entrepreneurial</span> minded social scientist who has noteworth <span>sales</span> and <span>management</span> skills. I work as a part-time sales associate for the 
			<a href="http://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank">
				Sherwin Williams Company
			</a> 
		while holding full-time contractual obligations to the
			<a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/" target="_blank">
				United States Air Force
			</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently I have one semester of undergraduate school left before I obtain my degree in
		<a href="http://www.uccs.edu/comm/undergraduate/tracks/fall_2011/organizational_strategic_communication_track_2011.html" target="_blank">
			Strategic/Organizational Communications
		</a> 
		from the 
		<a href= "http://www.uccs.edu/" target="_blank">
			University of Colorado at Colorado Springs
		</a>. 
		Afterwards, I plan to enroll in their Master's program for 
		<a href="http://innovation.uccs.edu/what-is-the-bi/" target="_blank">
			Business Innovations
		</a> 
		while continuing my education through 
			<a href="http://thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> 
		to become a Front End developer.
	</p>
	<p>
		My main objective for the next two years is to learn Python well enough to integrate it with my social science background and business expertise to become a consultant for whichever companies/agnecies are looking for someone with that skill set.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Where i am from
	</h2>
	<p>
		I was born and raised in the majestic Rocky Mountains of Colorado, right at the foot of Pikes Peak in a mid-sized town named 
		<a href="http://city-woodlandpark.org/" target="_blank">
			Woodland Park  
		</a>.
		This land blessed me with a deep seeded love for tall peaks, rock faces and snowy winters. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I bring the chill Coloroadan vibe along with me everywhere I go but also have a hardnosed patriotic backbone that can withstand any element thrown at me. I truly believe in working smarter and then harder to get <span>any</span> job done in the most effective manner.

		What Are Your Hobbies?
	</h2>
	<p id="hobbies-answer" class="active">
		I used to have a real passion for the game of baseball and still enjoy watching a <span>competitive</span> game to this day. However, I migrated from that path into one that is filled with campine, backpacking, mountaineering, skiing, and rock/ice climbing. Outside of those activities, I <span>love</span> traveling and experiencing new places, people and food.
